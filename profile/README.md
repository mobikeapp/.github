Commuting on bikes is way different than bicycling for sport or just using walking and public transit. We're also in a time where it's more important than ever to reduce our carbon emissions and free ourselves from running around everywhere in cars. Yet to this day no major mapping application includes proper multimodal routing in the US, meaning that commuters who could otherwise use their bikes and nearby transit to get through their day don't have any tools to plan their journeys, and as a result may not be empowered to make that change. Mobike is here to help, offering multimodal cycling + transit route mapping in the District of Columbia!
